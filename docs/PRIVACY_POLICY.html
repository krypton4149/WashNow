  <p>By using KwikWash, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <li><strong>Account registration (service center owners):</strong> Email, password, and after sign-up: business details including service center name, address, phone, location (latitude/longitude), opening hours, and week-off days.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile:</strong> When you edit your profile, we may store your name, phone number, and (for owners) your service center address and location.</li>
    <li><strong>Bookings:</strong> When you book a car wash, we collect and store the selected service center, date, time, vehicle number, optional notes, and (when applicable) the service chosen.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device and app usage:</strong> We may receive a device token (e.g. Firebase Cloud Messaging token) to send you push notifications about bookings, reminders, and updates. We may also collect your device type and operating system (e.g. Android) for compatibility and support.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> <strong>Customers:</strong> With your permission, we use your device's location to find nearby car wash centers and show you relevant results. Location may be sent to our servers to fetch nearby centers. <strong>Owners:</strong> With your permission, we use your device's location to set or update your service center's address and coordinates.</li>
    <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> The app stores data on your device (e.g. login token, user profile, theme preference, and cached data such as bookings and alerts) to keep you signed in and to improve performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Payment Information</h3>
  <p>Payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g. Stripe, PayPal). We do not store your full card number or full payment credentials. We may receive and store payment-related identifiers (e.g. transaction or booking IDs) to link payments to your bookings. Please refer to the respective payment provider's privacy policy for how they handle your payment data.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

    <li>Create and manage your account (customer or owner).</li>
    <li>Process and manage your car wash bookings and send related notifications.</li>
    <li>Show you nearby service centers (using location when you allow it).</li>
    <li>Enable owners to manage their service center profile and address (including location when you allow it).</li>
    <li>Send push notifications (e.g. booking confirmations, reminders, status updates) using your device token.</li>
    <li>Process payments through our payment partners and link payments to your bookings.</li>
    <li>Improve the app, fix errors, and personalize your experience.</li>
    <li>Respond to your support requests and communicate with you about the app.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <p>We may share your information in the following situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> With vendors who help us run the app (e.g. hosting, analytics, push notifications, payment processors). These providers are required to protect your data and use it only for the services they provide to us.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored on secure servers and, where applicable, in encrypted form. We use industry-standard measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. Sensitive data such as passwords are stored in an encrypted form. We do not store full payment card details; payments are handled by certified payment processors. Data stored on your device is subject to your device's security. We recommend keeping your device locked and your OS updated.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your account and profile data for as long as your account is active. We may retain certain data after account closure where required for legal, regulatory, or legitimate business purposes (e.g. completed transactions, dispute resolution). Cached data on your device may be cleared when you clear app data or uninstall the app. You can also log out to limit what remains in local storage.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>

    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data, subject to legal and operational requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of marketing:</strong> Unsubscribe from promotional communications (we use push mainly for transactional messages such as booking updates).</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> You can deny or revoke location permission in your device settings. The app may still work with reduced functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> You can disable push notifications in your device settings for the app.</li>
